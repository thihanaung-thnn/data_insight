    "# Classes \n",

    "In **Object-oriented Programming**, **classes** are written and based on these classes, **objects** are created. When creating objects based on these classes, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior of the class and then, each object can be given unique characteristics as you wish. \n",
    "\n",
    "For using classes that were created by other developers, there are two important concepts; **attributes** and **methods**. Attributes are charasteristics or properties of the class; in other words, they are NOUNS. Methods are what they can do for; or functions that are belonged to that class; or in other words, they are VERBS.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the real-world, let's say you buy a car, the brand name, color, engine type, size of the cars are attributes. Driving the car or moving from one place to another is a method. \n",

In this method, we have three parameters. The 'self' parameter is required in the method definition and it must come first before the others. Every method call associated with an instance passes the self and the individual instances access to the attributes and methods of that class."
