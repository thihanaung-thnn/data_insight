    "It is easy; just ask the person in front of you. This person will ask in front of him the same question until the frist one. Let's say it is asking phase. The first one will give back the answer \"There is no person in front, or zero\" to person behind, again, person behind will answer 'one' to behind, then 'two','three' till it finally reaches to you. This is answering phase. In programming, it is called **recursion**. A program is called recursive if it calls itself, thus reducing an instance of a problem to some other instance of the same problem. To be clear, recursive function is the function inside function inside function inside function, etc. The functions are the same function. \n",
